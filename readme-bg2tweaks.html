<h2>Notes</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod includes and deprecates three other mods: the <acronym title="Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> Tweak
    Pack, the Tutu Tweak Pack, and Wes Weimer's Ease of Use mod. </p> 
</div> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweak Pack is a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> compilation
    of fixes, cosmetic changes, and tweaks. Some of these were fan requests,
    others are needed fixes, and others simply make dealing with the more irritating
    aspects of the game engine easier. Each component can be installed separately
    so the player can pick and choose only which ones they wish to install. </p> 
  <p>This mod works on normal Baldur's Gate II games as well as either of the
    two Baldur's Gate conversion projects, BG1Tutu (Tutu) and Baldur's Gate Trilogy
    (<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>). </p> 
</div> 
<h2>Compatibility</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II; the Throne of Bhaal
    expansion pack is not required. Every component in this mod makes interactive
    changes and should, in general, be compatible with other mods. Except where
    noted, the tweaks adjust items or dialogues added by other mods. As such,
    it is highly recommended that you install this mod last if you wish to take
    full advantage of it. For example, installing a mod that adds weapons after
    you install Alter Weapon Proficiency System from Tweaks will mean that the
    mod's weapons may not use the new system. </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li> The Can't Kill Romance option of Romance Cheats should be used with
      caution with third-party <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> romance
      mods. </li> 
    <li>Multiple Strongholds (either variant) may not work correctly with Oversight's
      Cleric Kits component</li> 
    <li>The changes to Cromwell's dialogue in the Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher's
      Keep Items component should play nicely with other mods, provided the other
      mods don't mangle his dialogue (older versions of Item Upgrade, for example) </li> 
    <li>Certain mod items may not be affected by the item tweaks--in some cases,
      the tweak can not be made on the fly, so items to be modified are kept
      on static lists rather than a list made at installation time. If you find
      items not being modified by a certain tweak please report it to the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/?showforum=34">Tweak
      Packs forum</a>. </li> 
  </ul> 
</div>

</div> 
<h2>Contents</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweak Pack has many
    components, which can be installed completely independently of one another.
    For convenience, they are grouped into five broad categories. At installation
    time, players can select or ignore entire categories to streamline the installation
    process.</p> 
  <h3>Cosmetic Changes </h3> 
  <p>This batch of tweaks generally changes the look and feel of the game, without
    making general rule changes or altering the underlying mechanics of the engine. </p> 
  <p><strong>Remove Helmet Animations</strong><br /> 
    Many don't like how any of the helmets look on the character avatars. Now
      they can't be seen at all - just like ioun stones. This component will
      affect <em>all</em> helmets in the game, including helmets introduced by
      mods.</p> 
  <p><strong>Imoen Avatar Change</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    This component will change Imoen's avatar from a thief to a mage.</p> 
  <p><strong>Nalia Avatar Change</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    This component will change Nalia's avatar from a mage to a thief.</p> 
  <p><strong>Viconia Skin Color Change</strong><br /> 
    A fan request, this component will change Viconia's in-game avatar to have
      dark blue skin to match her default portrait.</p> 
  <p><strong>Avatar Morphing Script</strong><br /> 
    This script allows you to select whatever <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> avatar
    you wish for your character or any joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>.
    Assign this script to the character whose avatar you wish to change. To change
    the avatar return to the game screen, ensure the party <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> in
    on (and the game is not paused) and press 'S'. This will take you to the
    avatar selection screen. Once the morph is complete re-assign a combat script
    to the character. Please note that this component can cause slowdowns on
    older systems. </p> 
  <p><strong>Weapon Animation Tweaks</strong><br /> 
    By default, spears in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> use
    33% overhead swings, 33% backhand swings and only 34% thrusting attacks.
    Wouldn't it make more sense to use the pointy end?</p> 
  <p>This component adjusts the attack animation balances of various weapons
    classes: spears, staves, short swords, and one-handed blunt instruments such
    as clubs and maces. Spears and short swords now primarily use thrusting attacks
    and staves are more consistent as a class and use more swinging attacks.
    A handful of clubs and maces were using thrust attacks; they now only use
    swinging attacks like all other one-handed blunt weapons. This component
    also changes morningstars to use a mace animation when attacking, instead
    of the flail-like ball-and-chain animation. Morningstars are depicted in
    inventory icons and description pictures as being closer to spiked maces.
    This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items
    introduced by mods. </p> 
  <p><strong>Icewind Dale Casting Graphics (Andyr) </strong><br /> 
    When your character casts a spell, you get a pretty sequence of colors swirling
      around their hand depending on the school the spell cast came from. A necromantic
      spell, for example, looks quite different from creating an illusion. The
      Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games use different sets of animations for
      the schools. This component changes the spellcasting animations to those
      of Icewind Dale. Note that this is purely a cosmetic change--the spells
      themselves function exactly as before. Screenshots for comparison are available
      in the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/portraits/thumbnails.php?album=18">Tweaks
      gallery</a>. </p> 
  <p><strong>Restore <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> Load Screen
      Logo</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em>, <em>Requires Throne of Bhaal </em><br /> 
    This component will restore the <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> logo
    to the load screens with Throne of Bhaal installed. On the left is the load
    screen with Throne of Bhaal installed; on the right is the restored Shadows
    of Amn screen with this component. This component will not work if you have
    biffed your override folder, a common practice for many large mods. Screenshots
    for comparison are available in the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/portraits/thumbnails.php?album=18">Tweaks
    gallery</a>. </p> 
  <p><strong>Disable Portrait Icons Added by Equipped Items</strong><br /> 
    This component will prevent items from displaying the small icons (fire resistance,
      protection from charm) that appear on the character portrait while equipped.
      This will not affect the actual effects of the items, only the display
      of the icon. It will also not affect icons added by spells or other means. </p> 
  <p><strong>Commoners Use Drab Colors</strong><br /> 
    Unlike Icewind Dale, commoners in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> wear
    brightly colored clothes. This tweak changes the random selections of colors
    for commoners to a drab palette. The dress of noblemen and noblewomen are
    not affected. </p> 
  <p><strong>Icon Improvements </strong><br /> 
    This component uses a combination of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>, <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>,
    and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> icons to better differentiate
    armor when it is on the ground. It also restores the inventory icon to the
    Case(s) of Plenty. Screenshots for comparison are available in the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/portraits/thumbnails.php?album=18">Tweaks
    gallery</a>. </p> 
  <p><strong>Change Avatar When Wearing Robes or Armor (Galactygon)</strong><br /> 
    This component will change characters' avatars to a mage if they equip a
      robe or a fighter/thief/cleric if they equip armor. This allows a thief/mage,
      for example, to equip a robe and look like as if he is actually wearing
      one, and then equip a piece of leather armor, and look like a thief. This
      component will affect all items in the game, including those added by mods. </p> 
  <p><strong>Force All Dialogue to Pause</strong><br /> 
    This component will change all dialogue to pausing. No longer will bandits
      attack in the middle of a conversation. This component will affect <em>all</em> dialogues
      in the game, including ones introduced by mods. </p> 
  <h3>Content Changes </h3> 
  <p>These components make alterations to content in order to provide a better
    player experience. </p> 
  <p><strong>More Interjections</strong><br /> 
    <em> Previously known as Valen/Solaufein-Style Interjections</em><br /> 
    One of the more common triggers for dialogue interjections does not quite
    work as well as intended--Irenicus not realizing Yoshimo is in your party
    at Spellhold is a common example. This component will interactively replace
    these faulty triggers with a simple in-party check, similar to the Valen
    or Solaufein mods. The net result is that some characters may be chiming
    in on conversations from half-a-map away, but it also means no more silliness
    such as Irenicus missing Yoshimo when he's standing four feet away. If party
    members are in another area, this component could cause some dialogues to
    exit early. This component will affect <em>all</em> dialogues and scripts
    in the game, including ones introduced by mods that use the IsValidForPartyDialogue
    trigger, provided this component is installed after them. </p> 
  <p><strong>Alter <acronym title="Hit Point">HP</acronym> Triggers for <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Wounded
      Dialogues</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    Many <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> have banters for
    when they are wounded. However, the triggers are typically for <acronym title="Hit Point">HP</acronym> levels
    so low that many players never see them. This component will raise the <acronym title="Hit Point">HP</acronym> trigger
    level so that the player has a better chance of seeing these dialogues.</p> 
  <p><strong>Reveal Wilderness Areas Before Chapter Six</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    This component will allow you to travel to the three wilderness areas from
    the City Gates area at any point in the game. Previously, the Small Teeth
    Pass, North Forest, and Forest of Tethyr areas were not available until chapter
    six. Please note that while not incompatible per se, this may cause conflicts
    with mods that set encounters in these areas that assume you've completed
    the story through chapter six. </p> 
  <p><strong>Make Cloakwood Areas Available Before Completing the Bandit Camp </strong><br /> 
    <em>Tutu, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> Only</em> <br /> 
    This component will allow you to travel to the Cloakwood forest from a nearby
    area prior to completing the Bandit Camp. This will allow you to explore,
    complete Cloakwood quests, and pick up Cloakwood <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> earlier
    in the game. The component has two options: open up the first area only (with
    the lodge and Aldeth Sashenstar) or open up all four wilderness areas, leaving
    just the mines themselves inaccessible until after the Bandit Camp. </p> 
  <p>This functionality is also available from the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Project.</p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Athkatlan City Guard (Andyr)</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    The Amnish guards aren't really tough enough to keep the peace in the cities,
    what with all the thieves and vampires around. This component makes the various
    Amnish guards and the like slightly tougher, and gives them a chance of summoning
    backup in the form of either another guard, a Sanctioned Wizard or a Militia
    Cleric.</p> 
  <p>Please note that the guards aren't amazing killing machines, and this isn't
    aiming to make the game a hardcore battle experience. You won't get much <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> or
    loot for randomly going around killing soldiers, either. But it might make
    such activities a little more interesting.</p> 
  <p><strong>Gradual Drow Item Disintegration </strong> <br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    Rather than your drow items turning to dust immediately upon exiting the
    Underdark, they will gradually degrade over time. They also have a chance
    to break every time they are used in combat. Please note that this component
    adds a number of item checks to the main game script; as such it can cause
    slowdowns when you have a very large number of items in your inventory and
    bags of holding. </p> 
  <p><strong>Breakable Nonmagical Armor, Helms, and Shields<br /> 
    </strong><em>Tutu Only</em> <br /> 
    The iron crisis in the Sword Coast means that nonmagical iron weapons can
    break when used in combat. This component will extend the same vulnerability
    to nonmagical iron armor, helmets, and shields to close an oversight by the
    game. </p> 
  <p>This tweak is not available for Baldur's Gate Trilogy as it contains this
    functionality by default.</p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Multi-Player Kick-out Dialogues (Weimer)</strong><br /> 
    This allows you to ask multi-player created <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to &quot;wait
    here&quot; or, if accessible, to go to the Copper Coronet (in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>)
    or Pocket Plane (in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>). For
    Tutu or the Baldur's Gate portion of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>,
    the option to go to the Friendly Arm Inn is available. Without this they
    just disappear forever if you kick them out. </p> 
  <p><strong>Add Bags of Holding</strong><br /> 
    In the Shadows of Amn portion of the game, this component adds potion cases
      to the stores of Roger the Fence and Mrs. Cragmoon and ammo belts to the
      stores of the Trademeet blacksmith and Perter. </p> 
  <p> Bags will also be added to the Baldur's Gate portion of Tutu and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> games.
    This component will add a gem bag to the Friendly Arm Inn store, a scroll
    case at the High Hedge, an ammo belt to Thunderhammer Smithy, a potion case
    to the Nashkel General Store, and a bag of holding at the Sorcerous Sundries
    in Baldur's Gate.</p> 
  <p><strong>Exotic Items Pack</strong><br /> 
    <em>Tutu, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> Only</em> <br /> 
    This component adds a handful of weapons and items available in Baldur's
    Gate II and scatters them throughout stores, creatures, and containers in
    the Baldur's Gate portion of the game. Items include katanas, wakizashis,
    scimitars, ninja-tos, bags/quivers of plenty, ioun stones, and a handful
    of spell scrolls. However, please note that the items have been placed with
    an eye towards balance and likelihood that they would be on the Sword Coast
    at all. The exceptions are scimitars, which are definitely less exotic than
    the other items and hence more plentiful.</p> 
  <p>This component also fixes a known bug in the game, in that the merchant
    at Gullykin and the Helm temple in Nashkel shared the same store file. </p> 
  <p><strong>Reveal City Maps</strong><br /> 
    <em>Tutu Only </em> <br /> 
    In Baldur's Gate II, city maps were revealed as soon as you entered the area.
    This component will reveal the maps of Baldur's Gate, Nashkel, Beregost,
    Candlekeep, and (if Tales of the Sword Coast is installed) Ulgoth's Beard.
    This tweak is not available for Baldur's Gate Trilogy as it contains this
    functionality by default.</p> 
  <p><strong>Add Map Notes</strong><br /> 
    <em>Tutu Only</em><br /> 
    This component will add map notes to many Baldur's Gate areas throughout
    the game, including some wilderness areas. This process is done interactively,
    so no areas are overwritten. This tweak is not available for Baldur's Gate
    Trilogy as it contains this functionality by default.</p> 
  <p><strong>Stores Sell Larger Stacks of Items</strong><br /> 
    This component will alter all stores in the game to use higher stacks of
      arrows, bolts, bullets, darts, throwing axes and throwing daggers. This
      component will affect <em>all</em> stores in the game, including ones introduced
      by mods. </p> 
  <p><strong>Reputation Resets at Beginning of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></strong><br /> 
    <em><acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> Only</em><br /> 
    When making the transition from the end of Baldur's Gate to the beginning
    of Baldur's Gate II, this component will reset the party's reputation back
    to its default value (from 8-12, depending on the protagonist's alignment).
    It doesn't make sense that the party could emerge from the opening dungeon,
    head over to the Adventurer's Mart, and get hero discounts (or villain markups)
    from Ribald. Despite the events of Baldur's Gate, the protagonist and the
    party are more or less unknown in Amn.</p> 
  <p><strong>Gems and Potions Require Identification</strong><br /> 
    This component assigns a lore value to gems and potions, meaning that they
      now require identification. Lore value is calculated by an algorithm based
      on the value of the item, but smaller gems and lesser potions should still
      be fairly easy to identify by the party. </p> 
  <p><strong>Shapeshifter Rebalancing (Weimer)</strong><br /> 
    Please note that this is a legacy component from Wes Weimer's Ease of Use
      mod. Wes typically designed for balance under the assumption that people
      would have the Tactics mod installed, so this is probably overpowered for
      most normal games. The rest of the description is from Wes: </p> 
  <p> Shapeshifter abilities now create &quot;symbolic paws&quot;. When you wield
    one you turn into a Werewolf, when you remove it you're human again. There
    are no possible exploits and you may choose whether to put the paw in your
    on-hand or off-hand. Since your off-hand <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> as
    a pure druid is, shall we say, sub-optimal, I recommend the on-hand. This
    fixes the bug where the Shapeshifter's paws could be dispelled and then any
    weapon could be put in their place. That exploit essentially gave you two
    extra attacks with whatever you wanted, plus all the werewolf powers. </p> 
  <p>This also fixes a &quot;bug&quot; where attributes of the <abbr title="creature">CRE</abbr> file
    for &quot;<acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> polymorphed into
    a Werewolf&quot; were not actually given to the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> by
    the Polymorph opcode. For a normal werewolf: </p> 
  <table summary="Comparison of Werewolf Shapeshift Attributes"> 
    <tr> 
      <th>You Were Supposed to Receive... </th> 
      <th>You Actually Received... </th> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
      <td>Base magic resistance 20% </td> 
      <td>Magic resistance locked at 20% </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
      <td>Immunity to normal weapons </td> 
      <td>Nothing</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
      <td>Paw does <acronym title="1 roll of a 12-sided die">1d12</acronym> slashing
        damage </td> 
      <td>Paw does <acronym title="1 roll of a 6-sided die">1d6</acronym> piercing
        damage </td> 
    </tr> 
  </table> 
  <p>For the greater werewolf:</p> 
  <table summary="Comparison of Greater Werewolf Shapeshift Attributes"> 
    <tr> 
      <th>You Were Supposed to Receive... </th> 
      <th>You Actually Received... </th>

    <tr> 
      <td><acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> of 6 </td> 
      <td>Nothing</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
      <td>Saves 1/1/1/2/1 </td> 
      <td>Nothing</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
      <td>Base elemental resistance of 50% </td> 
      <td>Elemental resistance locked at 50% </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
      <td>Base magic resistance of 40% </td> 
      <td>Magic resistance locked at 40% </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
      <td>Immunity to normal weapons </td> 
      <td>Nothing</td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
      <td>Paw is +3 weapon </td> 
      <td>Paw is +2 weapon </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
      <td>Paw does <acronym title="2 rolls of an 8-sided die">2d8</acronym> slashing
        damage </td> 
      <td>Paw does <acronym title="1 roll of a 6-sided die">1d6</acronym> piercing
        damage </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
      <td>Regeneration of 3 <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym> per second </td> 
      <td>Nothing</td> 
    </tr> 
  </table> 
  <p> To see this for yourself, check out werewodr.cre, weregrdr.cre, brbrp.itm,
    etc. </p> 
  <p>The &quot;Rebalancing&quot; gives a greater werewolf shapeshifter the +7 <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym> per
    Level due to a fighter with 25 <acronym title="Constitution">CON</acronym> (before
    you just got +2). Most importantly, shapeshifters may now cast spells while
    shapechanged. Yuan-Ti, Githyanki, Sahuagin, etc. can all cast spells--why
    not wolfmen? </p> 
  <p>In addition, the Druid spell choices were a bit weak in some areas, so some
    Priest-only spells were made Priest-Druid: Sanctuary (sylvan sanctuaries
    abound), Chant (they got Bless, why not Chant?), Zone of Sweet Air (sounds
    nature-y to me!), Glyph of Warding (no excuse, but they need a damaging spell
    here that isn't Call Lightning), Righteous Magic (listen to Jaheira for a
    while and tell me she's not Righteous ... more importantly, if they're going
    to tank around they need some extra help).</p> 
  <p>Finally, 99% of all sixth-level druid spell slots go to &quot;Summon Fire
    Elemental&quot;. You can get a 24 hit dice monster with +4 claws that lasts
    for hours with that spell. It's so much better than the 7th level &quot;Summon
    Earth Elemental&quot; that it isn't funny. The other 6th-level summons just
    don't come close. To give you some actual choices, &quot;Conjure Animals&quot; has
    been changed to summon two 20 <acronym title="Hit Dice">HD</acronym> Greater
    Bearweres (they're like Greater Wolfweres). However, the duration remains
    4 turns. Do you want Fire Elementals forever or Mighty Big Tanks for a short
    time? You decide. </p> 
  <p><strong>Multiple Strongholds (Sabre, Baldurdash, Weimer) </strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    This component comes in two variants. The first is the original from Ease
    of Use, which allows any character, regardless of class, to acquire as many
    strongholds as wanted. The second variant is similar, but retains the class
    restrictions--so a fighter-mage can acquire the Planar Sphere and de'Arnise
    Keep, but would not be offered the Thieves' Guild or membership in the Noble
    Order of the Radiant Heart. In the original game, you were also not able
    to decline the Five Flagons Playhouse, the cabin in the Umar Hills, or the
    Druid Grove. In either variant of this component, the player can now decline
    these strongholds when offered. </p> 
  <p><strong>Bonus Merchants (Baldurdash, Weimer) </strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    This adds Joluv and Diedre to the Copper Coronet and Ribald's Mart, respectively. </p> 
  <p><strong>Female Edwina (Davide Carte, Wendy Yung, Weimer) </strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    This patch gives Edwina a female portrait to go with her female soundset
    and female paper doll. This patch was originally written by Davide Carte.
    This version includes Wendy Yung's &quot;Edwina&quot; portrait, a modified
    version of the original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> art
    (thus it looks seamlessly like part of the original game). </p> 
  <p> You can override the portrait by putting your own Royo4L.bmp and Royo4S.bmp
    files in the override directory.</p> 
  <p> <strong>Romance Bug Fixes (Sabre, Richardson)</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    This module applies some bug fixes to the romance scripts. It's highly recommended
    that you at least install this module to fix a few glitches in the original
    game romance scripts. If the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II"><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2</a></acronym><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/"> Fixpack</a> is
    installed, this component will be skipped as this fix is already included
    in the Fixpack Core Fixes. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Imoen ToB Dialogue Fix (jcompton)</strong> <br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em>, <em>Requires Throne of Bhaal </em><br /> 
    This fixes about 15 places where Imoen had banter dialogue in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> but
    you couldn't see it because of a spelling error in the game. If the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II"><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2</a></acronym><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/"> Fixpack</a> is
    installed, this component will be skipped as this fix is already included
    in the Fixpack Core Fixes. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Use <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> Walking Speeds
      (BETA) </strong><br /> 
    From Tutufix, this will make folks walk slower, as they did in the original
    Baldur's Gate. While it's most useful for Tutu and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> players,
    you will be able to install it on a bogstandard <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> game.
    Since this component had some issues in Tutufix (notably when interacting
    with polymorph or haste/slow spells) it's being labeled a beta until the
    issues can be worked out. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher's Keep Items</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em>, <em>Requires Throne of Bhaal </em><br /> 
    It's never made sense to me that Cromwell can forge armor out of red dragon
    scales, ankheg shells, and shadow dragon armor--but doesn't even acknowledge
    the white dragon scales you can acquire in Watcher's Keep. This component
    will allow Cromwell to forge items found in Watcher's Keep using the same
    formulae as Cespenar. (Note that only the formulae using items you can <em>legally</em> obtain
    in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> are implemented; if you
    cheat in a component from Sendai's Enclave you'll still be out of luck.)
    This component will allow the party to obtain some high-level items in Shadows
    of Amn, so be warned that this may ruin the balance in SoA and make the remainder
    of the game fairly easy. The component will make one minor tweak to Cespenar
    as well--normally, he can only add the electric head to the Flail of Ages
    after the poison head has been attached. This component will allow him to
    add the heads in any order. </p> 
  <h3>Rule Changes </h3> 
  <p>These components make alterations to rules, game mechanics, and other aspects
    of the underlying game. </p> 
  <p class="deprecated"><strong><acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> Spell
      Progression Tables - DEPRECATED </strong><br /> 
    This component has been deprecated. If you wish to use <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> spell
    tables, use the Alter Mage Spell Progression Table, Alter Bard Spell Progression
    Table, Alter Cleric Spell Progression Table, and Alter Druid Spell and Level
    Progression Tables components instead.</p> 
  <p><strong>Two-Handed Bastard Swords</strong><br /> 
    It always seemed odd that the general description of bastard swords implied
      they could be wielded with two hands. This tweak adds an ability to all
      bastard swords that will create a two-handed version of the sword in your
      inventory. The one-handed version will be removed. The new sword will have
      the animation of a two-handed sword but, in all other respects, will be
      the same as the one-handed version. You can switch back to the one-handed
      version at any time. The ability is found behind the backpack icon, once
      the sword is equipped. This component will not affect items introduced
      by mods. </p> 
  <p><em>Note:</em> Instances may occur when a bastard sword appears to have
    a selling price of 1 <acronym title="Gold Piece">gp</acronym>. Resting will
    fix this.</p> 
  <p><strong>Two-Handed Katanas<br /> 
    </strong><em>Requires Exotic Items component on Tutu installs</em> <br /> 
    This tweak adds an ability to all katanas that will create a two-handed version
    of the sword in your inventory. The one-handed version will be removed. The
    new sword will have the animation of a two-handed sword but, in all other
    respects, will be the same as the one-handed version. You can switch back
    to the one-handed version at any time. The ability is found behind the backpack
    icon, once the sword is equipped. Monks cannot wield two-handed katanas.
    This component will not affect items introduced by mods. </p> 
  <p><em>Note:</em> Instances may occur when a katana appears to have a selling
    price of 1 <acronym title="Gold Piece">gp</acronym>. Resting will fix this.</p> 
  <p><strong>Universal Clubs</strong><br /> 
    From the description of a basic club in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>:
    'Anyone can find a good stout piece of wood and swing it'--so why can't mages
    use clubs? This tweak allows mages to wield clubs as well as gain a proficiency
    point in clubs. This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game,
    including items introduced by mods. As of v8, all item descriptions will be
    patched in this component and the less-friendly and less-comprehensive
    description updating component will be skipped.</p> 
  <p><strong>Description Updates for Universal Clubs Component</strong><br /> 
    <em>Requires Universal Clubs</em><br /> 
    This component will update the descriptions of clubs altered by the Universal
    Clubs component to reflect that they're usable by mages. This will only affect
    clubs available in the original <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> games.
    This component will not install if Ashes of Embers is installed, as <acronym title="Ashes of Embers">AoE</acronym> already
    adjusts club descriptions to reflect that they are universal. As of v8, all item
    descriptions will be patched in the main Universal Clubs component, rendering this
    component obsolete for everyone except Chinese users.</p>
  <p><strong>Weapon Styles for All</strong><br /> 
    This allows all classes, not just warriors, to gain the maximum number of
      points in the various weapon styles. Some restrictions remain:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Mages are not allowed Sword and Shield Style (they can't use shields
      anyway).</li> 
    <li>Kensais are not allowed Sword and Shield Style (they can't use shields
      anyway).</li> 
    <li>Monks are only allowed Single Weapon Style.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><em>Note:</em> This component affects weapon <em>styles</em>, <em>weapon
      proficiencies</em> remain unaffected.</p> 
  <p class="deprecated"><strong>Druids Use Cleric Level and Spell Progression</strong><strong> -
      DEPRECATED </strong><br /> 
    This component has been deprecated. If you wish for druids to use cleric
    spell and level progressions, use the Alter Druid Spell and Level Progression
    Tables instead.</p> 
  <p><strong>Delay High Level Abilities</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu, Requires Throne of Bhaal </em><br /> 
    High Level Abilities start at level 21 for all classes. </p> 
  <p><strong>Change Experience Point Cap</strong><br /> 
    In Baldur's Gate II, characters have a maximum experience point cap of 2,950,000
      with Shadows of Amn or 8,000,000 with Throne of Bhaal. In Tutu (Baldur's
      Gate), these caps are 89,000 in the standard game and 161,000 with the
      Tales of the Sword Coast expansion. This component will allow you to alter
      the experience point cap in one of three ways:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Remove completely (characters can advance without restriction up to level
      50) </li> 
    <li>Cap at level 20</li> 
    <li>Cap at level 30 </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>For a challenge, combine the level 20 cap with Delay High Level Abilities
    to never get access to <acronym title="Use Any Item">UAI</acronym> and Improved
    Alacrity. </p> 
  <p><strong>Allow Stealth and Thieving Abilities in Heavy Armor per <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym></strong><br /> 
    In <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, thieves and rangers are
    prevented from using stealth and thieving skills while in heavy armor. This
    component implements the <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> method
    of allowing these abilities in heavier armor, but at a penalty to the character.
    There is always a small chance of success or failure regardless of the adjustments
    below. Any armor above leather will impose penalties on these skills. This
    component will affect some mod items; if you find armor not affected by these
    tweaks, please report it at the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/?showforum=34">Tweak
    Packs forums</a>. The adjustment of the item descriptions to reflect these
    changes has now been incorporated directly into this component and is done
    on-the-fly, so it should also catch mod-added items and reduce conflicts.
    (Note that descriptions are only adjusted if there are translations available.)

  <p class="deprecated"><strong>Descriptions Updates for Stealth and Thieving

    This component has been deprecated, as it is now included directly in the
    Allow Stealth and Thieving Abilities in Heavy Armor per <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> component. </p> 
  <p><strong>Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor</strong><br /> 
    This component will allow mages with access to armor the ability to wear
      it and cast arcane magic, though at a miscast penalty. It will not allow
      mages to wear armor they normally can not, but it will broaden the selection
      for multi and dual-class mages. The penalty will not affect divine magic.

  <p class="deprecated"><strong>Descriptions Updates for Allow Arcane Spellcasting
      in Armor Component - DEPRECATED</strong><br /> 
    This component has been deprecated, as it is now included directly in the
    Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor component. </p> 
  <p><strong>Expanded Dual-Class Options</strong><br /> 
    This component will allow Barbarians and Wild Mages to dual-class to other
      classes. Barbarians will have the same dual-class options (cleric, druid,
      mage, and thief) with the same requirement (15 strength) as fighters. Wild
      Mages will have the same dual-class options (cleric, fighter, and thief)
      with the same requirement (15 intelligence) as regular mages. </p> 
  <p><strong>Wear Multiple Protection Items</strong><br /> 
    This component allows players to wear more than one &quot;X of Protection&quot; item
    at a time. Players have their choice of two different implementations (from
    Ease of Use and <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym>/Tutu
    Tweaks respectively):</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>No restrictions. Players can wear as many items together as they wish. </li> 
    <li> <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> Style: In Pen and Paper <acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym>,
      characters are allowed to wear magical armor with Rings/Cloaks/Amulets
      of Protection, but only the armor class bonus from one item would apply.
      This component gives every ring/cloak/amulet of protection the ability
      to be worn with or without its Armor Class bonus. With the <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> bonus,
      the items retain their usual restrictions from being worn with other protection
      items or magic armor. Without their <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> bonus,
      they can be worn together. This allows players to gain the benefits of
      the saving throw bonuses from the items of protection. To toggle between
      the versions that offer armor class bonuses and those without, use the
      item's special ability--the new item will be created in your inventory. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Alter Weapon Proficiency System</strong><br /> 
    This component provides three different options to allow you to change how
      the weapon proficiency system works. </p> 
  <p> The first option, Rebalanced Weapon Proficiencies, attempts to rebalance
    the groupings of weapons proficiencies. There are three main changes:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li> Wakizashis move from Wakizashi/Scimitar/Ninja-to to Katana proficiency</li> 
    <li> Ninja-tos move from Wakizashi/Scimitar/Ninja-to to Short Sword proficiency</li> 
    <li> Morningstars move from Flail/Morningstar to Mace proficiency</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Wakizashis are very similar to katanas in usage, and ninja-tos are straight,
    short blades. Morningstars, while there are several variations in definition,
    are essentially spiked maces in the game, and have been moved out of the
    flail category and grouped with maces. The proficiencies themselves get renamed
    to reflect these changes. Weapon descriptions also get updated (English only). </p> 
  <p>The second and third options are variants of using the old <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>-style
    system of proficiencies. In <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>,
    the weapons proficiencies were not as specialized (i.e. Large Swords covered
    bastard swords, two-handed swords, and long swords) and there were fewer
    categories. While mainly aimed at Tutu and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> players
    to allow them to have a game experience closer to <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>,
    these two options will work on a <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> game.
    The two options only vary in allowing the weapon style proficiencies (i.e.
    Two-Handed Weapon Style, Single Weapon Style, etc.) to be included or not
    at the player's discretion. If you import your characters to another game
    without this component you will need to use Shadowkeeper to change their
    proficiencies to the standard <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> set. </p> 
  <p><strong>Cast Spells from Scrolls (and Other Items) at Character Level</strong><br /> 
    Scrolls and a few other items allow your party to cast spells from the item.
      When cast in this fashion, the spell is cast as if the character using
      the item is at 10th level in terms of determining damages, durations, etc.
      This tweak will allow you to cast spells from items at your character's
      level, instead of the fixed value of 10. In the Baldur's Gate portion of
      the game, this will be a nerf of scrolls, whereas it will be more akin
      to a cheat in the Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal portions of the game. </p> 
  <p class="deprecated"><strong>Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table,

    This component has been deprecated. The <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> table
    changes are available in the new Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table
    component. Arcane spell progression changes are available in the Un-Nerfed
    Sorcerer Spell Progression Table, Alter Mage Spell Progression Table, and
    Alter Bard Spell Progression Table components and divine spell progression
    changes are available in the Alter Cleric Spell Progression Table and Alter
    Druid Spell and Level Progression Tables components. The saving throw changes
    are actually fixes and already included in the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack
    and Baldurdash; the grandmastery changes have always been available as a
    separate component, True Grandmastery.</p> 
  <p><strong>Shopkeepers Have Limited Identification Ability </strong> <br /> 
    This component makes the identification abilities of stores more in line
      with the shopkeepers' abilities. There are three ways to implement this,
      and players are given a choice:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Only mages and bards can identify items. Any non-mage, non-bard shopkeeper
      can not identify items at all. Mages and bards can identify any item.</li> 
    <li>Identification based on lore. Any shopkeeper can identify items up to
      their personal lore value, regardless of class. The shopkeepers are given
      a slight lore boost over normal characters to reflect their occupational
      experience with magical items. Items with exceptionally high lore may not
      be able to be identified at all by shopkeepers. </li> 
    <li>Hybrid. Mage and bard shopkeepers can identify anything, and other shopkeepers
      have lore scores based on their character. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Multi-Class Grandmastery (Weimer)</strong><br /> 
    This is for players who believe that <acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons'">AD&amp;D's</acronym> dual-class
    and multi-class system is inherently broken and that there is no conceptual
    reason for multi-class characters to be denied grandmastery. Multi-class
    characters can now put more than two pips in things. In effect, any multi-class
    character that could put two stars in anything can now put five stars in
    that thing. </p> 
  <p> <strong>True Grandmastery (Schumacher, Weimer)</strong><br /> 
    This is the standard Baldurdash / <acronym title="Team Baldur's Gate">TeamBG</acronym> &quot;un-nerfed&quot; grandmastery
    patch. In <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> and <acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym> guidelines,
    going from four to five proficiency points in a weapon reduces <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> by
    one, adds one to damage rolls, and gives an extra attack per round to 5/2.
    In <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, it only adds one to damage.
    Rather takes the "Grand" out of "Grandmastery" I think. Install this patch
    to restore Grandmastery to what it was. </p> 
  <p><strong>Change Magically Created Weapons to Zero Weight</strong><br /> 
    Nearly all magically created items in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> have
    zero weight, though there are a few exceptions. This component will change
    Melf's Minute Meteors, Jan's Flasher Master Bruiser Mates, weapons created
    by Enchanted Weapon, Shillelagh, and a few others to have zero weight. This
    component will not affect items introduced by mods. If the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II"><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2</a></acronym><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/"> Fixpack</a> is
    installed, this component will be skipped as this fix is already included
    in the Fixpack Core Fixes. </p> 
  <p><strong>Make +x/+y Weapons Consistent</strong><br /> 
    The engine does not handle weapons such as the Bastard Sword +1/+3 vs. Shapeshifters,
      Hammer +1/+4 vs. Giantkin, and Daystar +2/+4 vs. Evil Creatures consistently.
      In all but a few cases, the weapon uses the higher of the two bonuses as
      its enchantment level, which determines what the weapon can hit--for example,
      spell protections such as Mantle or creatures such as Kangaxx. This component
      will make all weapons of this nature use the higher of the two bonuses
      as their enchantment; i.e. Daystar will be treated as a +4 weapon. If the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II"><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2</a></acronym><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/"> Fixpack</a> is
      installed, this component will be skipped as this fix is already included
      in the Fixpack Core Fixes. </p> 
  <p><strong>Description Updates for Make +x/+y Weapons Consistent Component</strong><br /> 
    <em>Requires Make +x/+y Weapons Consistent</em><br /> 
    This component will update the descriptions of items altered by the Make
    +x/+y Weapons Consistent component to reflect their adjusted enchantment
    level. </p> 
  <p><em>Warning</em>: If another mod has altered one of the items, the
    descriptions added by this component may not be accurate as they are based
    on an unmodded game. This will not affect gameplay or the ability of the
    items, as the descriptions are purely cosmetic. This component will detect
    Ashes of Embers and adjust descriptions accordingly.</p> 
  <p><strong>Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table<br /> 
    </strong>A spin-off of the deprecated Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table,
    Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression component,
    this allows the player to select the un-nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> table
    individually. <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> can now
    progress until it reaches zero instead of no longer improving once you hit
    level 20. </p> 
  <p><strong>Un-Nerfed Sorcerer Spell Progression Table<br /> 
    </strong>This is the same table from the deprecated Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table,

  <p><strong>Alter Mage Spell Progression Table<br /> 
    </strong>This component offers two variants for mage spell progression. The
    first option is the same table from the deprecated Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table,
    Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression component
    and the second is the progression table from <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym>,

    first option is the same table from the deprecated Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table,
    Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression component
    and the second is the progression table from <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym>,

  <p><strong>Alter Cleric Spell Progression Table<br /> 
    </strong>This component offers two variants for cleric spell progression.
    The first option is the same table from the deprecated Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table,
    Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression component
    and the second is the progression table from <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym>,

  <p><strong>Alter Druid Spell and Level Progression Tables<br /> 
    </strong>This component is actually the combination and streamlining of three
    different components: <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> Spell
    Progression Tables;, Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table,
    Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression; and Druids
    Use Cleric Level and Spell Progression. These are now combined and made more
    granular so that the player can select exactly which level and spell progression
    tables they wish to use. A <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/readmes/readme-bg2tweaks_tables.html#druid">comparison
    of the spell progression tables</a> is available. </p> 
  <p><strong>Triple-Class <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym> Tables</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu, Requires Throne of Bhaal </em><br /> 
    <em>Requires Change Experience Point Cap - Remove completely</em> <br /> 
    This component will max out the <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym> tables
    for fighter-mage-thieves and fighter-mage-clerics. Throne of Bhaal originally
    used the fighter-thief table for fighter-mage-thieves and the fighter-cleric
    table for fighter-mage-clerics. Both the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack
    and Baldurdash alter this so that the triple-classes have unique tables and
    add the three Extra 6/7/8 Level Spell <acronym title="High-Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> from
    the mage tables. This component adds even more mage <acronym title="High-Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> to
    the tables, at the expense of other <acronym title="High-Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> from
    the other two classes. Fighter-mage-clerics lose access to Deathblow, Greater
    Deathblow, and War Cry and gain access to Improved Alacrity, Dragon's Breath,
    Summon (Dark) Planetar, and Comet. Fighter-mage-thieves lose access to Deathblow,
    Greater Deathblow, War Cry, Alchemy, and Scribe Scrolls and gain access to
    Energy Blades, Improved Alacrity, Dragon's Breath, Summon (Dark) Planetar,
    and Comet. Since triple-classes require 9 million <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> to
    reach a level where they can use 9th level mage spells, this component requires
    removal of the experience point cap. This component will overwrite the <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym> tables
    for the two triple-classes. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Add Save Penalties for Spells Cast by High-Level Casters (BETA) </strong><br /> 
    By request, this component will adjust spells to have save penalties when
      cast by high-level casters. For every five levels over the minimum level
      required to learn a spell, a -1 to saves will be imposed. </p> 
  <p> For example, Hold Person is a second level cleric spell, and can be learned
    when a character hits level three. When the character hits level eight, the
    spell now has a -1 penalty to the victim's saving throw. At level 13 it's
    -2; at 18 it's -3, etc. all the way out to -9 at level 48. The penalties
    are extended out to level 50 in case players are playing an XP cap-free game
    or with one of the various level-50 rule sets. </p> 
  <p> The penalties will work against you for spells from enemies, but I expect
    this component will, in general, probably make the game a lot easier. You'll
    have the choice to add these penalties to divine spells, arcane spells, or
    both. </p> 
  <p>NOTE: This component has been flagged as beta. There have been sporadic
    reports of crashes with this component installed, but I have not yet been
    able to replicate and solve these issues. If you should encounter issues
    with this component, please file a bug report at the mod's forum--I really,
    really want to get this nailed down and fixed. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Trap Cap Removal (Ardanis/GeN1e) </strong><br /> 
    Courtesy of Ardanis/GeN1e, this component will allow you to bypass the hardcoded
      limit of seven active traps. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Remove Delay for Magical Traps (Ardanis/GeN1e) </strong><br /> 
    Also from Ardanis/GeN1e, this component will remove the triggering delay
      for skull trap, glyph of warding, and delayed blast fireball. This should
      make them more effective during fights. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Remove Summoning Cap for Celestials (Ardanis/GeN1e)</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu, Requires Throne of Bhaal</em> <br /> 
    Courtesy of Ardanis/GeN1e, this component will allow you to bypass the hardcoded
    limit of one active celestial (planetar or deva).</p> 
  <h3>Convenience Tweaks and/or Cheats</h3> 
  <p>These components seek to remove annoying aspects of the game or to make
    it easier. </p> 
  <p><strong>Higher <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym> on Level Up</strong><br /> 
    This component provides the player with a choice of two options that will
      increase average <acronym title="Hit Points">HPs</acronym> when characters
      level up. </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Maximum. This option will ensure that the dice roll will always be the
      highest available.</li> 
    <li><acronym title="Neverwinter Nights">NWN</acronym>-style. This option
      will ensure that the range of possible <acronym title="Hit Points">HPs</acronym> gained
      will always be in the higher half of the range, i.e. results will always
      be 4-6 on <acronym title="1 roll of an 6-sided die">1d6</acronym>, 5-8
      for <acronym title="1 roll of an 8-sided die">1d8</acronym>, etc.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><em>Please note that barbarian characters will interact badly with this
      component</em> due to their hardcoded nature. The Maximum option will not
      affect them, and the NWN-Style will cause them to roll 5d12 for their hit
      points. </p> 
  <p><strong>Maximum <acronym title="Hit Points">HP</acronym> Creatures (the
      bigg)</strong> <br /> 
    This component, based on code from the bigg, will alter creatures to have
    their theoretical maximum hit points. Creatures will get either a hit point
    total based on maximum hit dice rolls appropriate to their level, or their
    current hit point total--whichever is higher. The user has three choices
    with this component: </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>All creatures</li> 
    <li>Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> only (cheating
      version of this component)</li> 
    <li>Non-Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> only
      (difficulty increasing version of this component)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Identify All Items</strong><br /> 
    Annoyed with having to identify items all the time? Now you don't have to.
      This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items
      introduced by mods, save one: an item from Shadows of Soubar will remain
      unidentified, as a quest revolves around it being unidentified. </p> 
  <p><strong>Easy Spell Learning <br /> 
    </strong> <em>Previously known as 100% Learn Spells</em><br /> 
    This component makes it easier for arcane spellcasters to scribe scrolls
    to their spellbook. The player has a choice between two implementations:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>100% Learn Spells. Scribing scrolls is always successful.</li> 
    <li>100% Learn Spells and unlimited spells per level. In addition to the
      above, this implementation removes the limits on the maximum number of
      spells learned per level. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Bottomless Bags of Holding</strong><br /> 
    This component will alter every bag of holding to have unlimited capacity.
      Scroll cases, ammo belts, gem bags and the regular bags of holding will
      be changed. This component will not affect what you can place in the bags,
      just the capacity. This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the
      game, including items introduced by mods. Please note that every time a
      script checks for an item, it'll have to parse everything you're carrying,
      so keep this in mind if you begin to experience slowdowns when carrying
      a lot of items. . </p> 
  <p><strong>Remove Fatigue from Restoration Spells</strong><br /> 
    This component removes the fatigue that occurs when a character casts a Lesser
      or Greater Restoration spell. </p> 
  <p><strong>Shut Up &quot;You Must Gather Your Party ...&quot; (Weimer)</strong> <br /> 
    Disables the sound file played when you try to move less than a full party
      into or out of a party-required area. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Change Effect of Reputation on Store Prices</strong><br /> 
    <em>Previously Known As Low Reputation Store Discount (Sabre, Richardson,
    Weimer)</em><br /> 
    This component has been broadened into a general alteration of how reputation
    affects store prices. The original variant, Low Reputation Store Discount,
    is unchanged: reputation values of 8-13 result in no discounts; items are
    sold at their original prices. Every point lower or higher then 8 or 13,
    respectively, gives the party a 5% discount. This reaches a maximum of 35%
    -- meaning that the party will only pay 65% of the item's original price
    -- at reputation values of 1 and 20.</p> 
  <p>Three new variants, courtesy of Luiz, remove the effect of reputation on
    storekeepers outright. The resulting prices can be set to 60%, 80%, or 100%
    of their listed values in general, but note that storekeepers will retain
    their original markups and buy discounts. </p> 
  <p><strong>Unlimited Ammo Stacks</strong><br /> 
    This tweak will adjust the maximum number of ammo--bullets, arrows, bolts,
      darts, throwing axes and throwing daggers--in a stack to 9,999. This component
      will affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items introduced
      by mods. </p> 
  <p><strong>Unlimited Jewelry and Gem Stacks</strong><br /> 
    This tweak will adjust the maximum number of gems and jewelry in a stack
      to 9,999. This component will <em>not</em> affect magical rings or amulets.
      Bandit scalps will also be affected by this component. This component will
      affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items introduced by mods. </p> 
  <p><strong>Unlimited Potion Stacks</strong><br /> 
    This tweak will adjust the maximum number of potions in a stack to 9,999.
      This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items
      introduced by mods. </p> 
  <p><strong>Unlimited Scroll Stacks</strong><br /> 
    This tweak will adjust the maximum number of scrolls in a stack to 9,999.
      This component will affect <em>all</em> items in the game, including items
      introduced by mods. </p> 
  <p><strong>Happy Patch </strong><br /> 
    This component disables <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> complaining
    about the party's reputation. For example, evil characters will no longer
    be unhappy in a high reputation party. This component will also disable the
    BioWare <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> from fighting
    with one another: in Baldur's Gate, Kivan/Viconia, Tiax/Quayle, etc. and
    Keldorn/Edwin, Valygar/Viconia, etc. in Baldur's Gate II. This component
    is completely compatible with the Neutral Characters Make Happy Comments
    at Mid-Range Reputation component. </p> 
  <p>Please note that installing Virtue with this component will essentially
    nullify it. Virtue changes reputation checks to check Virtue instead, so
    this component will be changed to prevent your party members leaving due
    to Virtue--but the kicker is that they'll now leave due to reputation. </p> 
  <p><strong>Neutral Characters Make Happy Comments at Mid-Range Reputation (Luiz) </strong><br /> 
    Every joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> has lines
    they say when they're happy, ambivalent, or upset about the party's reputation.
    In the original tables, neutral characters would never be happy--even at
    mid-range reputation values, they would remain ambivalent. This component
    alters the reputation table so that they are now happy at middle of the road
    values, so you can now hear lines from neutral <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> which
    were previously not available. This component is completely compatible with
    any variant of the Happy Patch.</p> 
  <p>Please note that installing Virtue with this component will essentially
    nullify it. </p> 
  <p> <strong>No Traps or Locks (Weimer)</strong><br /> 
    All floor traps that can be disarmed are removed from the game. All door
      and container traps are removed from the game. All locked doors and containers
      have their lockpick difficulty set to 0 (they can be bashed open by anyone
      in one blow). All hidden doors have their detect difficulty set to 0 (anyone
      will detect them by standing around long enough). &quot;Special&quot; traps
      remain. Note that since the traps are gone entirely you cannot get <acronym title="Experience Point">XP</acronym> by
      disarming them. Note also that some doors that you &quot;should not be
      able to open early&quot; can now be bashed open early--don't do that if
      it will annoy you. </p> 
  <p><strong>Faster Chapter 1&amp;2 Cut-Scenes &amp; Dreams (Karzak, Blucher,
      aVENGER, Weimer) </strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    If you're replaying the game for the Nth time, this component saves precious
    minutes. In general this skips or shortens cut-scenes and dream sequences.
    You can also speed up your first encounter with Gaelan Bayle by saying (3) &quot;Yes,
    show me to your home.&quot; and then (5) &quot;Very well, I'll be back with
    the money.&quot;</p> 
  <p>There are two options for this component: the original cutscenes from the
    Ease of Use mod, and a non-silly version. The originals featured lines which
    really broke the fourth wall, such as the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> using
    lines from Neeber and Irenicus and Imoen leaving happily together after the
    party escaped to the Promenade. </p> 
  <p><strong>Invisible Cloak of Mirroring / Spell Trap and Physical Mirror (Weimer)</strong> <br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    This turns off that huge glowing white wiffle ball animation for the <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> Cloak
    of Mirroring and the Spell Trap spell as well as the glowing disc for physical
    mirror effects (e.g. Balduran's Shield, Shield of Reflection). </p> 
  <p><strong>Keep Drizzt's Loot, Disable Malchor Harpell (Weimer)</strong> <br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    If you kill Drizzt and take his stuff, Malchor Harpell appears and takes
    it back. This would make more sense in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> where
    his loot was actually powerful. By that point in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>,
    Drizzt's loot is mostly worthless and Malchor feels heavy-handed and out
    of place. </p> 
  <p><strong>No Drow Avatars on Party In Underdark (Weimer)</strong> <br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    Adalon the Silver Dragon normally changes the party to look like drow cosmetically.
    Unfortunately, the game engine has a number of bugs related to this that
    cause the <acronym title="Player Characters">PCs</acronym> to &quot;stutter&quot; and &quot;stop
    walking&quot; and whatnot (especially if they have regeneration items). This
    disables the cosmetic drow avatar bit only: the plot remains unchanged. </p> 
  <p><strong>Romance Cheats (Sabre, Richardson, Weimer)</strong> <br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu</em><br /> 
    This component allows greater flexibility with the original BioWare romances.
    Please note that the multi-romance option may cause stuttering when used
    in conjunction with a third-party mod romance. The player can choose five
    parameters:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>No gender requirements (i.e. Aerie romances females) </li> 
    <li>No racial requirements (i.e. Anomen will romance a half-orc)</li> 
    <li>Multiple romances </li> 
    <li>Nothing kills romance (requires multiple romances)</li> 
    <li> Start romances for new games in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>These should provide 24 different variants of the romance options (12 for
    non-<acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> games). The 'Start romances
    for new games in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>' option is
    based, in part, upon the <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/npcflirt/"><acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Flirt
    Pack</a>'s version of same (and used with permission), but will also work
    in conjunction with the removal of gender and racial requirements and multiple
    romances. If all you're looking for is to start romances for new <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> games,
    use the Flirt Pack instead, as they provide a much more expansive treatment. </p> 
  <p><strong>Rest Anywhere (Japheth, Weimer)</strong><br /> 
    This component allows you to rest in any area. Inns and outdoor campsites
      are no longer required. </p> 
  <p><strong>Sellable Items (Icelus)</strong><br /> 
    <em>Previously known as Sellable Staffs, Clubs, and Slings</em><br /> 
    Originally, this component made previously unsellable staves, clubs, and
    slings sellable for a single gold piece as well as restoring the Root of
    the Problem club to its original selling price from <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>.
    It's been expanded to include other unsellable items, as well as introducing
    a store tweak: stores which buy arrows now buy bolts as well. The store changes
    will have little effect in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,
    but in Tutu games there are no stores that buy bolts. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Minimum Stats Cheat </strong><br /> 
    This component will let you set a universal minimum stat for all classes
      and kits. Minimum stats are a drawback in <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym>,
      but in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> it just makes your
      stats move upward to always meet the minimum--essentially an unnatural
      boost to your dice rolls at character creation. This component will allow
      you to select a minimum stat value between 6 and 15. Note that at higher
      minimums, your flexibility in re-distributing the points can become more
      and more limited. Play around with the range to find a minimum that works
      for you. </p> 
  <h3>Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Tweaks </h3> 
  <p>Components in this category directly affect joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>. </p> 
  <p><strong>Adjust Evil Joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Reactions</strong><br /> 
    <em>Tutu, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> Only</em><br /> 
    In Baldur's Gate, most <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> use
    reaction rolls to determine their dialogue with the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>.
    Reactions rolls are <acronym title="20-sided die">d20</acronym> plus adjustments
    for charisma and party reputation. The problem is that the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> can
    get low rolls and evil joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> may
    refuse to join the party as a result--for evil <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> this
    doesn't make a lot of sense, as a low-reputation party is probably what they
    would prefer. This component adjusts the reaction rolls of evil-aligned joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to
    be more favorable. This doesn't mean that Viconia still won't leave without
    joining, but it makes it less likely. </p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Fate Spirit Summoning</strong><br /> 
    <em>Non-Tutu, Requires Throne of Bhaal</em> <br /> 
    This component aims to make the Fate Spirit summoning a bit more consistent
    within the game world. An extra condition is added for summoning <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> from
    the Fate Spirit in the pocket plane: you must have met them sometime in your
    travels in the Shadows of Amn portion of the game. If you never meet Mazzy,
    for example, you will not have the option to summon her. Like the existing
    Yoshimo option, the Fate Spirit will now comment appropriately if an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> is
    dead and beyond its reach. This component will not affect games started in
    Throne of Bhaal, only games where you are continuing from the end of Shadows
    of Amn. </p> 
  <p><strong><acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>-Style <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></strong><br /> 
    This component will alter all joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to
    join in the same fashion as Throne of Bhaal, where <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> immediately
    level-up upon joining, with a caveat: all creature files are moved down to
    their lowest experience version, so if you pick up an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> early
    enough they will not level upon joining. However, later in the game they
    will, allowing you to select weapon proficiencies, thieving points, and other
    goodies from the level-up process.</p> 
  <p><strong>Consistent Stats: Edwin </strong><br /> 
    A number of joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> that
    are in Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II have slightly different stats in
    both games. This component allows the player to use either the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> stats
    for Edwin for a consistent experience. The changes will only show up in your
    game if you have not met Edwin yet. </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Use <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> stats - gives Edwin 9
      Strength and 9 Wisdom, as he has in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym></li> 
    <li>Use <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> stats - gives Edwin
      10 Strength and 10 Wisdom, as he has in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></li> 
  </ul>

    A number of joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> that
    are in Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II have slightly different stats in
    both games. This component allows the player to use either the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> stats
    for Jaheira for a consistent experience. The changes will only show up in
    your game if you have not met Jaheira yet. </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Use <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> stats - gives Jaheira
      14 Dexterity, as she has in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym></li> 
    <li>Use <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> stats - gives Jaheira
      17 Dexterity, as she has in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Change Jaheira to Neutral Good Alignment </strong><br /> 
    A player request, this component brings Jaheira's alignment to Neutral Good
      to better reflect her actions and attitude ingame. The changes will only
      show up in your game if you have not met Jaheira yet. </p> 
  <p><strong>Consistent Stats: Minsc </strong><br /> 
    A number of joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> that
    are in Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II have slightly different stats in
    both games. This component allows the player to use either the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> stats
    for Minsc for a consistent experience. The changes will only show up in your

      Dexterity and 15 Constitution, as he has in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym></li> 
    <li>Use <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> stats - gives Minsc
      16 Dexterity and 16 Constitution, as he has in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Consistent Stats: Viconia </strong><br /> 
    A number of joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> that
    are in Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II have slightly different stats in
    both games. This component allows the player to use either the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> stats
    for Viconia for a consistent experience. The changes will only show up in
    your game if you have not met Viconia yet. </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Use <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> stats - gives Viconia
      15 Wisdom, as she has in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym></li> 
    <li>Use <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> stats - gives Viconia
      18 Wisdom, as she has in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage (Domi) </strong><br /> 
    <em>Tutu, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> Only</em><br /> 
    This component will change Khalid into a multi-classed fighter-mage, and
    includes a short dialogue. The changes will only show up in your game if
    you have not met Khalid yet. </p> 
  <p>Note that the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/lev1npcs/">Level 1 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></a> mod
    can also do this, and probably in a much slicker fashion. At the time of
    this release, it's currently in beta. </p> 
  <p><strong>Make Montaron an Assassin (Andyr)</strong><br /> 
    <em>Tutu, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> Only</em><br /> 
    This component changes Montaron into an Assassin. The changes will only show
    up in your game if you have not met Montaron yet. </p> 
  <p>Note that the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/lev1npcs/">Level 1 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></a> mod
    can also do this, and probably in a much slicker fashion. At the time of
    this release, it's currently in beta. </p> 
  <p><strong>Change Korgan to Neutral Evil Alignment </strong><br /> 
    A player request, this component alters Korgan's alignment to Neutral Evil
      to better reflect his actions and attitude ingame. The changes will only
      show up in your game if you have not met Korgan yet. </p> 
  <p><strong>Give Kagain A Legal Constitution Score of 19</strong><br /> 
    <em>Tutu, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> Only</em><br /> 
    Just as the title implies, this component will lower Kagain's constitution
    from his current value of 20 to the dwarven maximum of 19. The changes will
    only show up in your game if you have not met Kagain yet. </p>

<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Version 9 - May 1, 2010</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=19813">Fixed incorrect item code for greater malison in Exotic Item Pack</a> Wisp</li>
    <li>The patch that prevented NPCs from fighting and the patch that prevented the romance between Aerie and Haer'Dalis from beginning are now separate components. They are no longer part of the Happy Patch.</li>
    <li>Updated to <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v216</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Version 8 - September 18, 2009</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated German, Italian, and Spanish translations</li>
    <li>The following components now patch item descriptions: Universal Clubs,
      Wear Multiple Protection Items (<acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym>
      Restrictions), Two-Handed Bastard Swords, and Two-Handed Katanas</li>
    <li>Bottomless bags now have bottoms, stops items from falling out</li>
    <li>The Triple-Class <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym> Tables component
      now patches the appropriate files instead of overwriting them for greater
      compatibility with other mods</li>
    <li>The components Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage and Make Montaron an Assassin now take
      the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>-Style Weapon Proficiencies component 
      into account</li>
    <li>The Weapon Styles for All component now also affects mod-added kits</li>
    <li>Modified Improved Multi-Player Kick-out Dialogues component so it's no longer
      possible to tell the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> from 
      Obe's warehouse in Candlekeep to wait at the Friendly Arm Inn</li>
    <li>Corrected typo in Improved Multi-Player Kick-out Dialogues component:
      Friendly Arm Inn, not Friendly Arms Inn</li>
    <li>Updated the classification of four mod armors for the Allow Arcane Spellcasting
      in Armor and Allow Stealth and Thieving Abilities in Heavy Armor per
      <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> components</li>
    <li>Fixed bugs in the Alter Druid Spell and Level Progression Tables
      component where the wrong tables were being installed</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>-Style Weapon
      Proficiencies component that sometimes caused wild mage proficiencies to be messed up</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the Maximum <acronym title="Hit Point">HP</acronym> Creatures
      component relating to the Empathic Manifestation</li>
    <li>Added checks to prevent an installation failing if a file has been ALLOW_MISSINGed
      by another mod</li>
    <li>Updated to <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v211</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Version 7 - February 20, 2009</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated Italian translation</li>
    <li>Added VERSION flag</li>
    <li>Updated to <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> v210</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Version 6 - December 16, 2007</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added Chinese translation; thanks Miranda! </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with the Change Experience Point Cap: Remove Completely component
      to behave more sensibly for bards, clerics, monks, and thieves. These characters
      had an unnaturally large jump in <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> needed
      to go from level 39 to 40 (the old default level cap) and this was being
      propagated through the <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> tables
      out to level 50.</li> 
    <li>Fixed a bug with Make Montaron an Assassin (Andyr) component; the highest
      level version of Montaron was flagged a player-created character</li> 
    <li>Fixed a bug with the Improved Fate Spirit Summoning component that was
      preventing players in new <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> games
      from summoning any characters at all</li> 
    <li>Fixed a bug with Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher's Keep Items component;
      specifically there were errors when trying to upgrade the White Dragon
      Scales, Quiver of Plenty +1, and the Thieves' Hood</li> 
    <li>Fixed a long-standing game bug that interfered with Anomen's romance
      and quests. Essentially, non-romanceable females could never start Anomen's
      family and knighthood quests, and the Romance Cheats: No gender requirements
      component was essentially extending this bug to males. This is now fixed
      by Tweaks, and the relevant fix has also been passed along to the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack </li> 
    <li>Fixed bug where potions in the Gems and Potions Require Identification
      component would sometimes use gem descriptions</li> 
    <li>Fixed rare bug that could occur if you tried to install the Expanded
      Dual-Class Options component with the Refinements mod present in the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
      but without the Refinements <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym> component
      installed</li> 
    <li>Added compatibility code for the Alter Weapon Proficiency System: Rebalanced
      component to work nicely with Maurolava's Samurai Kit </li> 
    <li>Triple-Class <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym> Tables
      requires the Change Experience Point Cap: Remove Completely component installed,
      but was giving a nonsensical message if this requirement was not met </li> 
    <li>Fixed three bugs with Sellable Items: it would fail if older, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>-style
      store files were present (used by the Grey Clan and Secret of Bone Hill
      mods) or if installed without Throne of Bhaal. Also corrected the name
      of the component displayed during install </li> 
    <li><acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>-Style <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> would
      not affect Khalid or Montaron if the Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage or Make
      Montaron an Assassin components were installed after it. The dependency
      has been removed and these components can be installed in any order </li> 
    <li>Corrected contact email address displayed if the mod fails to install </li> 
    <li>Clarified various points in the readme; specifically balance concerns
      for Shapeshifter Rebalancing, the revised level cap for the Change Experience
      Point Cap: Remove Completely component, possible Happy Patch and Neutral
      Characters Make Happy Comments at Mid-Range Reputation conflicts with Virtue,
      and the possible use of <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/lev1npcs/">Level
      1 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></a> instead of
      the Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage or Make Montaron an Assassin components.
      Also flagged the Add Save Penalties for Spells Cast by High-Level Casters
      component as beta, as I still haven't been able to replicate or fix the
      reports of sporadic crashes with this component. Please keep the bug reports
      flowing in as I really want to get this one nailed down </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Version 5 - September 18, 2007</strong></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Altered the 'Start romances for new games in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>'
      aspect of the romance cheats to work like the <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Flirt
      Pack, as this seems a more streamlined and sensible approach </li> 
    <li>The creature files used in the Make Montaron an Assassin component used
      an unconventional ordering inside the file itself--the game was fine with
      them, but they were causing issues with other mods </li> 
    <li>Combined the two armor tweaks (Allow Stealth and Thieving Abilities in
      Heavy Armor per <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> and Allow
      Arcane Spellcasting in Armor) with their respective description updates.
      The descriptions are now updated on-the-fly (meaning mod items should also
      have their descriptions updated) and available in languages other than
      English. The separate description update components are now redundant and
      hence have been deprecated. </li> 
    <li>Added a full Italian translation--this was a lot of work from Andrea
      C., so thanks!</li> 
    <li> Readme now displayed at the beginning of installation, instead of after </li> 
    <li>Four more new components were added: Make Cloakwood Areas Available Before
      Completing the Bandit Camp, Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher's Keep Items,
      Remove Summoning Cap for Celestials (Ardanis/GeN1e), and the Minimum Stats
      Cheat</li> 
    <li>Adjusted code for the Add Save Penalties for Spells Cast by High-Level
      Casters component to interact better with malformed spells</li> 
    <li>Ardanis identified one more magical trap to be covered in the Remove
      Delay for Magical Traps component</li> 
    <li>Omitted needed script for the Restore <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> Load
      Screen Logo component to work on OS X </li> 
    <li>Thanks to the hard work of Caedwyr (and an assist from Shaitan), the
      Two-Handed Bastard Swords, Two-Handed Katanas, Allow Stealth and Thieving
      Abilities in Heavy Armor per <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym>,
      and Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor components now cover many more mod
      items </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Version 5 Beta 1 - July 15, 2007</strong></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Added new grouping for components, Cam's House Rules, which is a collection
      of Tweaks preferred by CamDawg </li> 
    <li>Four new components were added: Use <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> Walking
      Speeds (BETA), Add Save Penalties for Spells Cast by High-Level Casters,
      Trap Cap Removal (Ardanis/GeN1e), and Remove Delay for Magical Traps (Ardanis/GeN1e)</li> 
    <li>Weapon Animation Tweaks now adjusts one-handed blunt weapons such as
      clubs </li> 
    <li>The Gems and Potions Require Identification component now requires items
      to be identified before being able to use them</li> 
    <li>In Shapeshifter Rebalancing, the paws created were only usable by <acronym title="True Neutral">TN</acronym> characters,
      though there are now a variety of mods which allow non-<acronym title="True Neutral">TN</acronym> druids.
      The paws will now automatically detect allowed shapeshifter alignments
      at install and adjust the paws accordingly. </li> 
    <li>Fixed bug with Two-Handed Bastard Swords in Tutu; normal bastard swords
      should be breakable due to the iron crisis but the changes to the items
      were preventing breakage </li> 
    <li>Made under the hood changes to the Weapon Styles for All component so
      that it'll play nicer with other mods (thanks bigg) </li> 
    <li>Updated Refinements compatibility code for the Expanded Dual-Class Options
      component (thanks bigg) </li> 
    <li>Removed the option in Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table
      to allow <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> to progress
      to -10. There was a heretofore unknown hardcoded feature which caused <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> to
      wrap around to high values instead.</li> 
    <li>Invisible Cloak of Mirroring / Spell Trap component expanded to include
      the physical mirror visual effect and renamed Invisible Cloak of Mirroring
      / Spell Trap and Physical Mirror</li> 
    <li>Romance Cheats was completely revamped to provide greater flexibility
      to player. The previous four variants have been superseded by a five-question
      format with a resultant 24 unique variants.</li> 
    <li>Some components were not being auto-skipped for Tutu games, though they
      would not affect Tutu games</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Version 4 - February 10, 2007</strong></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Fixed bug with Force All Dialogue To Pause component that was preventing
      the completion of the tavern challenges in Ust Natha</li> 
    <li>The v3 documentation for Add Bags of Holding indicated that Roger was
      getting a potion case, though it was actually going to Mrs. Cragmoon. After
      discussion in the forums, it was decided to give potion cases to both of
      them. The documentation for the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> stores
      was also incorrect. </li> 
    <li>Many bugfixes and enhancements to Multiple Strongholds, most notably
      a new second option to retain the class restrictions but allow multiple
      strongholds for dual-and multi-class characters. Fixed reported bugs with
      acquiring the Thieves Stronghold and Planar Sphere. Enhancements to the
      component include being able to decline the Playhouse, Ranger Cabin, and
      Druid Grove strongholds as well as being able to claim you are an agent
      of Talos (truthfully or not, as appropriate) to Borinall in the Dawn Ring
      quest. </li> 
    <li>Deprecated <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> Spell Progression
      Tables, Druids Use Cleric Level and Spell Progression, and Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table,
      Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression components
      in favor of the new, more granular and individual components of Un-nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table,
      Un-Nerfed Sorcerer Spell Progression Table, Alter Mage Spell Progression
      Table, Alter Bard Spell Progression Table, Alter Cleric Spell Progression
      Table, and Alter Druid Spell and Level Progression Tables components (see
      main portion of readme for more details)</li> 
    <li>Fixed bug with Shopkeepers Have Limited Identification Ability component.
      If a shopkeeper had a dialogue call to open a non-existent store, this
      component would fail because it would try to patch the store file. The
      patch will no longer try to patch files which do not exist. </li> 
    <li>Low Reputation Store Discount has been rolled into a broader component,
      Change Effect of Reputation on Store Prices, and is available as one variant.
      Three new variants are introduced, allowing the player to remove the effect
      of reputation on stores entirely. </li> 
    <li>Sellable Staffs, Clubs, and Slings (Icelus) has been expanded and renamed
      Sellable Items (Icelus). Several more items have been assigned prices,
      and stores which buy arrows are now altered to buy bolts as well--this
      will have little effect in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>,
      but will make a big difference in Tutu, where no stores by default buy
      bolts. </li> 
    <li>The Romance Bug Fixes (Sabre, Richardson) component was not being suppressed
      for Tutu games, as they are unnecessary </li> 
    <li>Thanks to the hard work of the translators, all languages save Italian
      are now up to date. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Version 3 - October 8, 2006</strong></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Czech, Polish, German, and Spanish translations are up-to-date, with
      thanks to Razfallow, yarpen, Leonardo Watson, and Immortality respectively </li> 
    <li>Viconia Skin Color Change relies on matching creature names against known
      strings for Viconia; one string was not being accounted for and was used
      primarily by EasyTutu causing the component to sometimes not work on this
      platform</li> 
    <li>Fixed bug where Weapon Animation Tweaks could cause crashes when used
      in conjunction with Weimer's Underrepresented Items mod. The component
      was not accounting for one-handed staves, assigning them a non-existent
      attack sequence</li> 
    <li>Fixed bug where Restore <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> Load
      Screen Logo was failing to install due to bad paths to the shell scripts</li> 
    <li>Shapeshifter Rebalancing will now work if installed after Divine Remix</li> 
    <li> The readme listed a 'hybrid' option for Shopkeepers Have Limited Identification
      Ability, but no option was actually present. The option is now coded and
      available. The existing two options had their code tightened significantly. </li> 
    <li> Added the Make +x/+y Weapons Consistent, Description Updates for Make
      +x/+y Weapons Consistent Component, Change Magically Created Weapons to
      Zero Weight, Imoen ToB Dialogue Fix (jcompton), and Romance Bug Fixes (Sabre,
      Richardson) components from the deprecated <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> Tweaks
      and Ease of Use. These have been integrated into the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack
      as fixes, but they're still available separately for players who do not
      wish to use the Fixpack. The Shadows of Amn World Map Fixes component was
      not restored; the fixes are already included in Yacomo's worldmap as well
      as the Fixpack. </li> 
    <li>Fixed yet another Imoen bug with <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>-Style <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>:
      the Tutu versions of Imoen were being copied from an incorrect cutscene
      version of her</li> 
    <li><acronym>Items from the Exotic Item Pack will now be usable by all if
        Ashes of Embers is installed</acronym></li> 
    <li>Fixed bug with both of the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>-style
      options of the Alter Weapon Proficiency System component altering weapon
      descriptions incorrectly </li> 
    <li>Shadow Armor +3 is no longer subject to the Allow Stealth and Thieving
      Abilities in Heavy Armor per <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> component </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Version 2 - September 18, 2006</strong></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Fixed crashing errors with Restore <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> Load
      Screen Logo</li> 
    <li>Fixed bug with Change Avatar When Wearing Robes or Armor (Galactygon)
      preventing some protections from items from working </li> 
    <li>Imposed stricter safeguards on the 'Remove Completely' option of Change
      Experience Point Cap as it could fail if mods referenced non-existent files</li> 
    <li>Coded a better algorithm to extend the ability files of kits and classes
      for the 'Remove Completely' option of Change Experience Point Cap to extend
      ability tables to level 50 </li> 
    <li>Thanks to the bigg, added a new Alter Weapon Proficiency System component
      with three options: the formerly standalone component Rebalanced Weapon
      Proficiencies, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>-Style Weapon
      Proficiencies (with Weapon Styles), and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>-Style
      Weapon Proficiencies (without Weapon Styles)</li> 
    <li>Added a non-silly option for the Faster Chapter 1&amp;2 Cut-Scenes &amp; Dreams
      component for those who are in a hurry and don't like breaking the fourth
      wall</li> 
    <li>Fixed bugs with Faster Chapter 1&amp;2 Cut-Scenes &amp; Dreams not affecting
      the opening cutscene</li> 
    <li> Added an 'Ignore Race' option to the Romance Cheats component</li> 
    <li>Fixed bug with <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>-Style <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> on <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> games
      where the Imoen in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> was being
      copied from her <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> incarnation</li> 
    <li>Fixed bug with Multiple Strongholds not allowing (under certain circumstances)
      the player to attain the paladin stronghold</li> 
    <li>Added safeguard to Shopkeepers Have Limited Identification Ability so
      that it would still install even if other mods left 0-byte creature files
      in the game </li> 
    <li>French translation is now complete--thanks Anomaly </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Version 1 - July 31, 2006</strong></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Fixed bug where Breakable Nonmagical Armor, Helms, and Shields was actually
      breaking cloaks when armor was supposed to break </li> 
    <li>Fixed bug where Add Bags of Holding would fail to install on games with
      Throne of Bhaal installed</li> 
    <li> Stores Sell Larger Stacks of Items is now available to non-Tutu games</li> 
    <li>Made a first pass at addressing the issue of items having no charges;
      this affects the Two-Handed Bastard Swords and Two-Handed Katanas components
      as well as the <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> Restrictions
      option of the Wear Multiple Protection Items component. </li> 
    <li>Reclassified the Red Dragon Scale as plate armor for the Allow Stealth
      and Thieving Abilities in Heavy Armor per <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> and
      Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor components </li> 
    <li>Elven chain was mistakenly receiving a 50% miscast penalty in the Allow
      Arcane Spellcasting in Armor component</li> 
    <li>Drow Adamantite Chain +5 was receiving an incorrect description in Descriptions
      Updates for Allow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor Component</li> 
    <li>Fixed bug in Expanded Dual-Class Options where wild mages were erroneously
      unable to use several items including slings </li> 
    <li> Un-Nerfed <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class 0">THAC0</acronym> Table,
      Saving Throws, Grand-Mastery, and Arcane, Divine Spell Progression will
      no longer overwrite changes from the <acronym title="Pen and Paper">P&amp;P</acronym> Spell
      Progression Tables component, allowing both to be used together</li> 
    <li>Identify All Items should no longer show 'blue' items from drops and
      containers </li> 
    <li> Faster Chapter 1&amp;2 Cut-Scenes &amp; Dreams was overwriting the dream
      script, causing incompatibilities with other mods</li> 
    <li>Improved Fate Spirit Summoning now comments if an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> is
      dead and beyond it reach </li> 
    <li><acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>-Style <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> was
      using the wrong version of Imoen as a template, resulting in Imoen having
      no proficiencies when she joined (either in Spellhold or the opening dungeon)</li> 
    <li> Fixed bug where Make Khalid a Fighter-Mage would fail to install on
      Tutu games due to a bad string reference </li> 
    <li>Czech translation is now complete--thanks Razfallow! </li> 
  </ul>
